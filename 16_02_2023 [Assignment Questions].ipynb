    "### Question no.1: What is a database ? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "### Answer: A database is a software system that is designed to store, organize, and manage large amounts of structured and unstructured data. It provides an efficient and organized way to store and retrieve information quickly and securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL and NoSQL are two types of databases with different approaches to storing and retrieving data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.SQL databases (relational databases):\n",
    "### SQL (Structured Query Language) databases use a table-based data structure to store and organize data. They are best suited for applications where the data is highly structured and the relationships between different data entities are well-defined. SQL databases use a schema, which defines the structure of the data in a table, and queries to retrieve and manipulate data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.NoSQL databases (non-relational databases):\n",
    "### NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases do not use a table-based data structure to store and organize data. Instead, they use various data models, such as document, key-value, graph, or column-family. They are best suited for applications where the data is unstructured, or where the relationships between different data entities are not well-defined. NoSQL databases are more flexible and scalable than SQL databases, and can handle large amounts of data more efficiently. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are their data structure, query language, and suitability for different types of applications. SQL databases are best suited for applications with structured data and well-defined relationships, while NoSQL databases are best suited for applications with unstructured data and dynamic relationships."

    "### A primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table. It is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identify each row in the table. Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity, ensuring that each row in the table is unique and can be identified uniquely. Primary keys are typically used as the basis for relationships between tables. For example, in a database that stores information about customers and their orders, the customer ID column in the customers table could be used as the primary key, while the order ID column in the orders table could be used as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. The foreign key establishes a link between two tables, allowing data to be retrieved from both tables based on the relationship between the primary key and foreign key. For example, in a database that stores information about customers and their orders, the customer ID column in the orders table would be a foreign key that refers to the customer ID primary key in the customers table. This would allow us to retrieve data from both tables based on the relationship between the two columns.\n",
